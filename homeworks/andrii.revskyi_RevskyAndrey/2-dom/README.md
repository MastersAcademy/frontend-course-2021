### 2-DOM

* Main area - messages are inserted (newest at the bottom).
* Bottom area - the place for entering the text and button to send a text. On click on the button (or press Enter key on the keyboard) text disappears from the entering field and inserts to the Main area.
* ALL JS AND STYLES SHOULD BE MOVED TO SEPARATE FILES AND CONNECTED TO index.html BY TAGS

The task with an asterisk (optional):

* On Shift + Enter you should insert into the message break to a new line
* To the message insert the cross-icon, by clicking on which, the message should disappear.
